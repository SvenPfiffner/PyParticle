üå† PyParticle Renderer
======================

PyParticle is a python based particle simulation framework that allows easy experimentation with particle physics. Built with Taichi and powered by GPU-accelerated ray tracing, PyParticle is designed for students, educators, researchers, and curious minds who want to explore physical simulations without touching a graphics pipeline.

üéØ You focus on particles. PyParticle handles the pixels.

What is PyParticle?
-------------------

PyParticle is an educational rendering framework that:
- üí° Renders particle-based simulations in real-time using path tracing
- üéÆ Lets you explore scenes interactively (mouse + WASD controlled camera)
- üß™ Allows you to create custom simulations just by overwriting particle initialization and update logic
- üé• Captures screenshots and videos at the press of a button

Features
--------

- üß± Real-time ray-traced particle renderer
- üîß CPU or GPU rendering support via Taichi
- üñ±Ô∏è Interactive camera (mouse + keyboard)
- üí° Directional lighting, floor plane, and material shading
- üì∑ Screenshot + video capture
- üéì Clean architecture - ideal for teaching or experimentation

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites
Install Taichi and NumPy:

    pip install taichi numpy

### Run the Example Scene

    python main.py --scene_name HelloWorld

This runs SceneHelloWorld, which drops a grid of red particles into a simulated gravity field with floor collisions.

Create Your Own Scene
---------------------

Define a new class in scene_youridea.py like this:

```python
from rendering.scene import Scene

class SceneYourIdea(Scene):
def initialize_particles(self):
  # Initialize particles however you like
  pass

  def update_particles(self, dt):
    # Animate or simulate particles here
    pass
```

Then run it with:

    python main.py --scene_name YourIdea
